Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:


Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is a displine that involve the systematic approach to developing, designing, documenting, testing, and maintaining software systems. 
One will be required to apply engineering principles, practice software development with an aim of procoducing quality and very reliable software solutions.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is a structured approach to developing software systems that emphasizes systematic processes, methodologies, 
and practices to efficiently design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software products. 
It doesnt only involve the coding aspect but one is required to analyse his work, come up with a design, document his design,
git carry out testing on that design and finally carry out the project managemnt.
But on the ohter hand, traditional programming often refers to the act of writing code to solve specific problems without necessarily following a systematic process.
 Traditional programming may focus primarily on writing code to implement a solution without much emphasis on requirements analysis, design documentation, or testing.
 Both software and traditional programing involve the process of writing a code, the biggest difference is the approach and the scope of activities involvoled in the two activies.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
This is the process used in software engineering to carry out design, develop, test, deploy and maintain the software systems. This processes will involve:
1. Analysis- It involves gathering and analyzing user requirements to understand what the software system needs to accomplish
2. Design - It involves the system architecture, software components, and data structures are designed based on the requirements identified in analysis phase.
3. Implementation -It involves writing the actual code according to the design specifications.
4. Testing - The testing phase involves verifying and validating the software to ensure that it functions correctly and meets the user's requirements.
5. Deployment- Once the software has been thoroughly tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment for use by end-users.
6. Maintenance- After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored, updated, and modified to address issues, 
add new features, or adapt to changing requirements. 


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Gathering and Analysis; This initial phase involves gathering and understanding the requirements of the software system from stakeholders, users, and other sources. 
   It includes identifying the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as constraints and expectations for the software.
2. System Design:In this phase, the system architecture and overall design of the software are developed based on the requirements gathered in the previous phase.
3. Implementation (Coding); This phase involves actual coding or programming of the software based on the design specifications. 
Programmers write code using programming languages, 
following coding standards and best practices. The focus is on translating the design into executable code.
4. Testing: The testing phase involves verifying and validating the software to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly.
5. Deployment: Once the software has been thoroughly tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment for use by end-users.
 This phase may involve installation, configuration, data migration, and user training to ensure a smooth transition to the new system.
6. Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored, updated, and modified to address issues, 
add new features, or adapt to changing requirements. Maintenance activities may include bug fixes, performance optimization, and software updates throughout its lifecycle.
